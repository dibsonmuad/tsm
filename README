Goals:
    Production ready Hierarchical State machine. Every state machine runs in it's own thread and has it's own event queue. The event queue is thread safe.
    C++11 - no manual memory management, c++11 threads, std libraries where possible
    Experiment with glog
    Ease of installation/ distribution - use cmake

Code Review:
    Can't the StateMachine manage the EventQueue?
    
A simple hierarchical statemachine. Demonstrates use of stl to easily build up a state machine class.
1. Install cmake (sudo apt install cmake)
2. create a folder build within statemachine
3. cd build; cmake ..
4. make
