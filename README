Goals:
    C++11 - no manual memory management, c++11 threads, stl where I can.
    Experiment with glog
    Ease of installation/ distribution - use cmake
Issues:
    Unit test fails on OSX, works on Linux
    Now make it a HSM

Code Review:
    Can't the StateMachine manage the EventQueue?
    
A simple statemachine. Demonstrates use of stl to easily build up a state machine class.
1. Install cmake (sudo apt install cmake)
2. create a folder build within statemachine
3. cd build; cmake ..
4. make
